# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
	The idea for this app comes from struggling myself to find food at stores that are safe for my daughter to consume. My long-term goal
is to create something that can be used to quickly identify if an item is safe for someone to consume or not, based on whatever
dietary restrictions they may have. I realize this is an immense task, so for starters I want to create a more inclusive
library/directory of products that are sold at most stores and are free of common allergens. Later on I would like to expand this
library to also include products that fit other dietary restrictions, like foods low in sodium, cholesterol, fat. Or even diets
tailored to athletes/weight-trainers who may also have specific dietary needs.
	I have spent a great amount of time standing in aisles of stores and trying to speed-read through ingredients alongside my 
impatient little side-kick. More times than I'd like to admit, I made it all the way home before noticing a small italicized statement 
that mentions the product may have been manufactured in facility/using equipment that also processes (wheat, soy, milk, oats, rye) etc. 
It may not be the main focus when I start creating this application, but I do at some point want to integrate image recognition as a 
feature of this app. 
	My short-term goal for this app is to put together as much information as I can about products available at multiple stores which are 
safe for people who struggle with food allergies to any of the top 8 triggers. These 8 triggers cause 90% of all food allergy reactions: 
milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish. As I compile all of this information and work to create this tool I hope 
to teach myself not only whatever it takes to actually code the app, but also to learn more about allergies in general (being someone who never 
knew anyone that had food allergies until now). Hopefully the final product will not only save time for anyone living with these restrictions 
but also educate others about food allergies, nutrition information and dietary restrictions.

### Features
User Login - Users can create an account and save restrictions to their profile when logged in.

Search - Users can search the product library by ingredients to exclude, or certain nutrition info to include
			Users can search by store?

Favorite - Users will be able to 'favorite' products that fit their restrictions to a list 
			(Maybe further in to app development) save products to different lists? products I like, things I have not tried, etc.

Image recognition - Users can scan a barcode/take picture of product/use phone camera to recognize product packaging?
					to see if it fits the dietary restrictions they have


### Technologies
C#
EntityFrameworkCore?
ASP.NET Core MVC
LINQ?


### What I'll Have to Learn
Aside from learning more about food allergies and dietary restrictions, I am hoping to find at least some of the ingredient/nutrition info
data I need from some already-existing/publicly accessible lists(?) so that product information I manually retrieve is kept to a minimum.
I need to research image recognition technology and brush up on my C# knowledge. And although I am not positive which way I want to go 
about making the front-end more interactive, this is something I plan on taking the time to do as well.
